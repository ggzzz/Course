You'll need to filter the original data for rows whose temperature is greater than 80. Then use the `hightemp` DataFrame to create a third DataFrame called `cities` that specifies the number of days above 80 per city. To do this, you'll need to use the groupby function. Provide the count for the number of days above 80 degrees for the following cities."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["           Region  Country  State  Month   Day  Year  AvgTemperature\n","City                                                                \n","Abu Dhabi    5441     5441      0   5441  5441  5441            5441\n","       Region  Country  State  Month  Day  Year  AvgTemperature\n","City                                                           \n","Milan     136      136      0    136  136   136             136\n"]}],"source":["hightemp = df.loc[df['AvgTemperature'] > 80] \n","cities = hightemp.groupby('City').count()\n","print(cities.loc[cities['Day'] == 5441])\n","print(cities.loc[cities['Day'] == 136])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BoMtwwmJAYi5"},"source":["## Number of Days above 80 - Part 2\n","\n","Now that we have the `cities` DataFrame, we can find the largest of the count values from this DataFrame.
